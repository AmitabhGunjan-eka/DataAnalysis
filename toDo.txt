Done:
Naive Bayes Classifier
Decision Tree
Random Forest

Doing:
For understanding:
	Linear Regression (Conditional mean & distribution, hypothesis testing (t-test, z-test, F-test), Continuous probability distributions.)
	Probability distributions

To do:
Tools:
	Excel - Start it already!
	Python - Do all the assignments in python.
	R
Algorithms:
	Clustering/unsupervised learning:
		K-Means - online resources
		DBSCAN
		Hierarchical clustering
		Mixture models.
	Classification:
		K nearest neighbour classifiction - online resources
		Natural Language Processing (Text classification-using Naive Bayes in python) - online resources
	
	Theoretical study: Will discuss in some time.
		PCA
		SVD
		Neural Networks
		Support Vector Machines
